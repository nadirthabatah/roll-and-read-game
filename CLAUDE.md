# Roll & Read Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
A dyslexia therapy reading practice game built with Next.js, featuring dice-based word selection and speech recognition for reading assessment.

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL MVP

### ✅ Completed Features

#### **Core Game Mechanics**
- **Dice Rolling System**: Large, high-contrast 3D dice (256px) with black dots on white background
- **Word Selection**: 6 rows of words based on dice roll (1-6)
- **Speech Recognition**: 60-second recording window with Deepgram API integration
- **Scoring System**: Accuracy calculation based on speech-to-text comparison
- **Progress Tracking**: Row completion with visual feedback

#### **User Interface**
- **Clean Design**: Professional purple/white theme with excellent contrast for dyslexia
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle switch for accessibility preferences
- **No Blocking Popups**: Students can see words while recording (critical UX fix)

#### **Audio System**
- **Custom Dice Sound**: User-provided rolling dice audio
- **Sound Control**: Audio stops when dice stops rolling
- **No Extra Sounds**: Removed distracting button clicks and notifications

#### **Recording Interface**
- **Smart Button Text**: "Read these words" (clear instruction)
- **Voice Wave Animation**: Animated bars show recording is active
- **Manual Stop**: Click wave to stop recording early
- **60-Second Timeout**: Automatic stop if student doesn't finish manually

#### **Game Flow**
- **Settings Sidebar**: Level and category selection without leaving game
- **Auto/Manual Dice**: Toggle between automatic rolling and manual control
- **Word Refresh**: Get new words for practice sessions
- **Completion Celebration**: Confetti and positive feedback

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Next.js 15**: Modern React framework with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with proper dark mode
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Zustand**: State management for game data
- **Three.js Integration**: 3D dice rendering (replaced with simpler 2D for better UX)

### 🎨 Design Achievements
- **High Contrast**: Black dots on white dice with thick borders
- **Perfect Size**: 256px dice - not too big, not too small
- **No UI Blocking**: Recording happens inline, words stay visible
- **Professional Look**: Clean, therapeutic design suitable for therapy sessions

### 🔧 Technical Stack
```
Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Animation: Framer Motion + Canvas Confetti
Audio: Howler.js + Custom sound effects
Speech: Deepgram API + MediaRecorder API
State: Zustand store pattern
3D: Three.js + React Three Fiber (simplified to 2D)
```
